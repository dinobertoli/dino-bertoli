# What is this document?
This is a guide to Dino Bertoli – a very quick tour of my personality and quirks. The aim is to help friends and colleagues understand me better, to make our relationships easier and more fun and productive :) If you have questions or suggestions for changes, feel free to get in touch (or submit a pull request!).
# My core beliefs
**Life is too short to be overly serious.** I like to work hard and commit fully to whatever I’m doing, but I’ll be cracking jokes as I do so. Laughter is the best medicine and the only rational response to a bizarre, indifferent universe.

**Most people are inherently good.** If something has gone wrong or someone has offended me, it’s probably due to a quirk of the situation rather than an attribute of the person. Almost everyone wants the same thing: a happy, fulfilling life.

**My fundamental moral principle**: make things better where you can, leave the world better than you found it, be better today than you were tomorrow – incremental improvements are the key!
# I’m at my best
- In the morning
- In a peaceful environment (I know this is a funny contrast with how loud I am)
- When I’m trying to solve a challenging problem with other people I trust and admire
- Taking a doing approach to learning: letting me tinker and play with something will typically be the fastest route to me understanding it
- In an orderly physical space – my desk (and virtual desktop!) will typically be as neat as I can make it. This comes from my belief that in order to embrace chaos in some domains, you need to have a foundation of order and structure in others
# I can’t stand
**Negativity.** Identifying problems is fine and important, I just react better to this being part of a process towards finding a solution rather than an exercise in complaining.

**People on their phones or laptops in meetings.**

**Being told what to do without justification or consultation.** If I know why, I’ll be more motivated to work on the task, and I might find a better way to accomplish the desired outcome. This also goes for teams I work with: I’ll try to always provide context and justification rather than just ‘what’ to deliver.
# How I work best with others
Communication: DMs for quick or urgent topics, email for larger topics requiring thought, face-to-face for anything sensitive or requiring discussion or shared brainstorming.
In messaging software, I won't be offended if you go straight to asking me a question without any small talk or greeting – efficiency is the name of the game here. You can expect the same from me if we interact frequently.

I like to chat and banter a bit at the start of face-to-face meetings or video chats – build the relationship :)

I love walking meetings when possible

I thrive off information, so tell me everything

I may forget to follow up about something, so if you remind me I will be grateful

I don’t want to micro-manage people, so I will tend to err on the side of giving less context and instruction. If you need additional information, ask for it and I’ll be happy to provide!

I take the time to structure my communication to help the reader/listener understand as easily as possible, and I appreciate it when others do the same. E.g. using lists and bolded words in emails, and spending a couple of minutes to redraft any piece of communication longer than one or two sentences

Mistakes are fine and failure is a welcome price of learning; what’s not fine is being irresponsible or not caring about your work
# Known bugs with Daniel
My energy levels tend to fade in the afternoon

Volume setting seems to be permanently stuck slightly too high

Prefer to stay high-level, which means I can sometimes gloss over details

Sometimes take things personally that I shouldn't
# How you can help Daniel
Tell me stuff, and share what you're working on or excited about! I love information and learning new things

If I’ve offended you or do something that annoys you, schedule a 1:1 meeting and tell me – I would much rather be able to fix it than have you resent me

Introduce me to people in the fintech or product management space, or anyone you think I would get along with
# Other useful or fun info about me
I love board games, and although I’m quite competitive, my main pleasure is from seeing the game played well – so much so that I would rather another player good advice even if it is bad for me than stay silent

I founded an escape room back in Australia (Next Level Escape), which whetted my appetite for entrepreneurship – I want to start another company at some point

I can juggle! Three clubs in a normal pattern, three balls with various tricks, and four balls in a normal pattern although I am making good progress on five balls :)
